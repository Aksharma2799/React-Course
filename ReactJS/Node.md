### Advanced Node.js Questions

1. **What is the purpose of the `cluster` module in Node.js, and how does it work?**
   - **Answer:** The `cluster` module allows you to create child processes (workers) that share the same server ports, enabling you to take advantage of multi-core systems. Each worker runs on its own thread, but they can share server ports, which helps in load balancing and scaling. You can create a master process that forks child processes and distributes incoming requests among them.

2. **How do you manage large-scale applications in Node.js in terms of structure and modularization?**
   - **Answer:** For large-scale applications, it's crucial to follow modular design principles. This includes organizing the codebase into smaller, reusable modules, using a microservices architecture where appropriate, following design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller), and employing tools like Lerna for monorepo management. Additionally, TypeScript can be used to enforce strong typing and better structure.

3. **Explain the concept of backpressure in Node.js streams and how you handle it.**
   - **Answer:** Backpressure occurs when the writable stream receives data faster than it can consume. To handle backpressure, you can use the `pipe` method, which manages the flow automatically. Alternatively, you can manually handle backpressure by checking the `write` method's return value and using the `drain` event to resume writing when the buffer is ready.

4. **What is the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`? When would you use one over the other?**
   - **Answer:** `process.nextTick()` schedules a callback to be executed at the end of the current operation, before any I/O operations. `setImmediate()` schedules a callback to be executed on the next iteration of the event loop, after I/O operations. Use `process.nextTick()` for immediate but low-priority callbacks, and `setImmediate()` for I/O callbacks that should be executed in the next cycle.

5. **How does Node.js handle file system operations, and what are some common patterns for dealing with them?**
   - **Answer:** Node.js handles file system operations using the `fs` module, which provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Common patterns include using callbacks for asynchronous methods, promises, or the async/await syntax for better readability and error handling.

6. **What is V8, and how does it relate to Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** V8 is Google's open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which is used by Node.js to execute JavaScript code. V8 compiles JavaScript to native machine code, which significantly improves the performance of Node.js applications.

7. **Explain how you would implement a rate limiter in a Node.js application.**
   - **Answer:** A rate limiter can be implemented using middleware in an Express.js application. You can use libraries like `express-rate-limit` to set request limits based on IP addresses. Alternatively, you can implement a custom solution using an in-memory store like Redis to keep track of request counts and timestamps.

8. **Describe the purpose of `worker_threads` in Node.js and give an example of when you would use them.**
   - **Answer:** `worker_threads` allow you to run JavaScript code in parallel threads, which can be useful for CPU-intensive tasks that would otherwise block the event loop. Use `worker_threads` when you need to perform heavy computations or processing without affecting the performance of the main thread.

9. **What are some common security issues in Node.js applications, and how do you mitigate them?**
   - **Answer:** Common security issues include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and insecure deserialization. Mitigation strategies include using parameterized queries, escaping user input, implementing proper authentication and authorization, using HTTPS, and employing security middleware like `helmet` and `csurf`.

10. **How do you handle asynchronous errors in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** Asynchronous errors can be handled using try-catch blocks with async/await, using `.catch()` with promises, and error-first callbacks for traditional callback-based APIs. Additionally, centralized error-handling middleware in Express.js can catch and handle errors consistently across the application.

11. **Explain the concept of EventEmitter and how you would use it in a Node.js application.**
    - **Answer:** EventEmitter is a class in Node.js that allows you to create and handle custom events. You can use it to decouple different parts of your application, enabling one part to emit an event and another to listen and respond to it. This is useful for implementing the observer pattern, where changes in one component trigger reactions in another.

12. **What is `zero-downtime` deployment, and how do you achieve it in a Node.js application?**
    - **Answer:** Zero-downtime deployment ensures that the application remains available during the deployment process without any interruptions. This can be achieved using techniques like load balancers, blue-green deployments, canary releases, and using process managers like PM2 to gracefully reload the application without downtime.

13. **How do you debug memory leaks in a Node.js application?**
    - **Answer:** Debugging memory leaks involves using tools like `node --inspect`, Chrome DevTools, `heapdump`, and `memwatch` to monitor memory usage and identify leaks. Techniques include taking heap snapshots, analyzing memory profiles, and identifying objects that are not being garbage collected.

14. **What are some advanced techniques for optimizing the performance of a Node.js application?**
    - **Answer:** Advanced techniques include profiling and monitoring using tools like `clinic.js`, optimizing database queries, using caching strategies (e.g., Redis), employing load balancing and clustering, minimizing synchronous code, using HTTP/2, and optimizing front-end performance to reduce server load.

15. **How would you design a real-time chat application in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** A real-time chat application can be designed using WebSockets for bidirectional communication between clients and the server. You can use libraries like `socket.io` to manage WebSocket connections, implement a message broker (e.g., Redis) for message queuing and delivery, and ensure data persistence using a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

16. **What are the differences between Monolithic and Microservices architectures in Node.js applications?**
    - **Answer:** In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single unit, which can be simpler to develop and deploy but harder to scale and maintain. In a microservices architecture, the application is broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs. Microservices offer better scalability, maintainability, and flexibility but come with added complexity in terms of deployment, inter-service communication, and data consistency.

17. **What is HTTP/2, and how does it improve performance for Node.js applications?**
    - **Answer:** HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP protocol that offers performance improvements such as multiplexing, header compression, and server push. It allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection, reducing latency and improving page load times. Node.js supports HTTP/2, and you can enable it using the `http2` module.

18. **How do you handle cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** CORS can be handled using the `cors` middleware in Express.js, which allows you to configure the necessary headers to permit cross-origin requests. You can specify allowed origins, methods, headers, and credentials to ensure secure and controlled access to your API from different domains.

19. **Explain the role of the `libuv` library in Node.js.**
    - **Answer:** `libuv` is a multi-platform C library that provides Node.js with its asynchronous I/O capabilities. It handles the event loop, thread pool, and all asynchronous operations, including file system operations, network communication, timers, and more. `libuv` is crucial for Node.js's non-blocking I/O model.

20. **What are some best practices for writing scalable and maintainable code in Node.js?**
